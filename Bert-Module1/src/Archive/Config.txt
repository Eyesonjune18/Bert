This is the config for every important value Bert uses. We do not recommend editing this unless
you know what you are doing, as changing one value could make or break your trading performance.
All parameters (read: settings) are labeled with an explanation as well as what values will break
the bot when used. This is not an exhaustive list, just what we have tested.

BASIC TRADE PARAMETERS
Trade-Frequency: 60
 - The interval of time, in seconds, between trade events. You can think of this as how often the bot trades.
   Lower number = faster trading.
